// IDENTIFIER'S IN JAVA LANGUAGE:
/* ANS:- 
Name which is given to the java elements is known as 'IDENTIFIER'
ex: Class_name, Variable_name, Method_name, Package_name, Interface_name.
*/

class I{
public static void main(String [] args){
int a=10;
int s=100;
int string=20;
float Runnable= a + string;
System.out.println(Runnable);
System.out.print(s);
}
}

// output :
/* C:\Users\HP\Desktop\JAVA\Indentifier_in_java>javac I.java

/*Now lets know some Rules about the Identifiers:
1] a to z
2] A to Z
3] 0 to 9
4] only $ and _ allowed to use
5] never start with the digit.
6] case sensitive 
7] we can't use keywords as identifiers.
   but predefined interfaces AND class names in java we can use like string, Runnable.
